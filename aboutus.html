  <h3>We Love Food and People</h3>
    <p>One day, we noticed something simple: 
       people love looking at delicious food online, 
       and restaurants want more people to come try 
       their food. That gave us a big idea! What if we
       could help restaurants show off their meals in a 
       way that makes people excited to visit?</p>
    </section>	 

<section>  
  <h3> Pictures That Make You Hungry</h3>
    <p>We take fun, beautiful photos and videos of the 
       food restaurants make — the kind that makes people
       say, “Let’s eat there!” Our job is to help restaurants
       look amazing online so more people come in, try the food,
       and tell their friends. It’s all about making real connections 
       through great content..</p>

  <h3>Helping Restaurants Shine</h3>
    <p>We know running a restaurant is hard work, and not everyone 
       has time to post on social media. That’s where we come in. We
       take care of the online stuff so restaurant owners can focus on
       cooking and caring for their guests. We’re proud to help bring
       more happy customers to the places that make our favorite meals.</p>
